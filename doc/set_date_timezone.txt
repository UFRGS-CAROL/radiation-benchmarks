****Ubuntu distros****
run command: 
	$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

# This method is outdated, since 2019 loghelper lib uses localtime instead
# Global time.
It will apper a screen to choose 'Geographic area", do as follows:
	1- Choose option: "None of the above"
	2- Choose option: "GMT-0"

Set the time whith the command "date -s", for example:
	$ sudo date -s "19 JUL 2015 19:50:00"

# Do that instead
	1- choose the option that is the test that you are running
	For example:
	Los Alamos is MDT - Mountain Time Zone
	ChipIR is GMT+1

Now you are good to go, or at least you should be
Check with commands:
	$ date
and
	$ date -u
The commands should output the local and the universal time respectively

***Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora****

You can use timedatectl, to set timezone name run command
	$ sudo timedatectl list-timezones
To set new timezone
	$ sudo timedatectl set-timezone <timezone name>
Probably you will want UTC timezone

Check also the command timedatectl
	$ sudo timedatectl
if local time, univeral time and RTC time is not correct, set time with timedatectl command:
	$ sudo timedatectl set-time <YYYY-MM-DD>
	$ sudo timedatectl set-time HH:MM:SS


Alternativelly, you can find timezone files in directory "/usr/share/zoneinfo/"

The file "/etc/localtime" sets the time zone, therefore, change this file to link to the correct file in the timezone files directory
	$ sudo unlink /etc/localtime 
	$ sudo ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Etc/GMT-0 /etc/localtime

Set the time whith the timedatectl command or "date -s", for example:
	$ sudo date -s "19 JUL 2015 19:50:00"


Now you are good to go, or at least you should be
Check with commands:
	$ date
and
	$ date -u
and
	$ sudo timedatectl
The output should be the same time
