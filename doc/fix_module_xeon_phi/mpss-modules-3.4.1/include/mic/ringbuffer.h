Description: This is a generic ring buffer implementation to be used by
anyone who needs a ring buffer.  The ring buffer is maipulated
using Read and Write functions.  These functions perform all of
the necessary space checks and only complete the operation if
if the requested number of items can be read or written.  A
return value of false indicates that either the ring buffer
contains less then the requested number of items (for Read) or
there isn't enough space left in the ring buffer (for Write).
