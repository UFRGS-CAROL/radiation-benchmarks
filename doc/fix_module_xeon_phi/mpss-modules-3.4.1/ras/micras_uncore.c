/*
 * RAS handler for uncore MC events
 *
 * Contains code to intercept MC events, collect information
 * from uncore MCA banks and handle the situation.
 *
 * In case of a severe event, defined by corrupted context,
 * the handler will add a record of the event in the designated
 * EEPROM hanging off the Over Clocking I2C bus.  After that
 * a message will be sent to the SMC (enabling IPMI notifications)
 * and at last a message is sent to the host via the MC SCIF
 * connection.
 *
 * Lesser events will also be sent to the host on a 'FYI' basis,
 * but no rocord will be stored in the event log.
 *
 * This is in all aspects similar to the reaction to a severe
 * core MC event. Differences are in the MC bank access (mmio),
 * and that the event is delivered via an interrupt instead of
 * an exception. Still, the handler cannot expect any support
 * from the OS.
