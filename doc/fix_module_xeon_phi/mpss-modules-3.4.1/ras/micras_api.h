 *  - the counter units returned are Linux kernel jiffies,
 *    typically in range 1 - 10 ms, based on continous
 *    counters maintained by the kernel. The number of
 *    jiffies per second is reported for scaling purposes.
 *    In order to get a current 'utilization' figure, the
 *    host needs to query the counters at regular intervals
 *    and use this formula to achieve a percentage:
 *       u = ((c2 - c1) / (t2 - t1)) * 100
 *    or
 *       u = ((c2 - c1) * 100) / (t2 - t1)
 *    where t2 - t1 = elapsed jiffies between samples
 *          c2 - c1 = usage jiffy counts between samples
 *  - the listed counters does not add up to cover the
 *    wall clock time exactly, sampling errors do occur.
 *  - counters for iowait, irq, and softirq are not included.
 *  - jiffy counters are updated by the timer tick interrupt
 *    handler. It's accuracy is known to be limited, see
 *    Documentation/cpu-load.txt for details.
 *  - counters are reported regardless of core sleep states
