How to parse radiation logs and calculate cross section

1. Generate the CSVs files with summarized data
	- Run the script "first_parser_sdc-csv-generator.py" in the folder where the logs are located. The logs can be compressed in tar.gz files or just in folders
	- The script will create a folder called logs_parsed with the CSVs files

2. Get the neutron count logs from ChipIR, you must generate one file with all the data in order and each column separated by ';'
	- The columns must be:
		1. Date
		2. time
		3. decimal of second
		4. Dimond counter threshold=40mV (counts)
		5. Dimond counter th=20mV (counts)
		6. Dimond counter th=30mV (counts)
		7. Fission Counter (counts)
		8. Integral Current uAh
		9. Current uA
	- there is an example in the folder neutrons_count. countlog-*.txt are the files as they come from ChipIR, unified_logs is the file ready to be used by the cross section scripts

3. Run the script calcCrossSection.py to generate CSVs with the cross section computed by each run and in 1h timesteps
	- $ ./calcCrossSection.py <unified neutron count logs> <benchmark csv file>  <distance factor>
		- <unified neutron count log> generated at step 2
		- <benchmark csv file> csv file generated at step 1, usually is named like this: logs_parsed_carol-k402.csv
		- <distance factor> float number computed by the distance of the board from the shutter
