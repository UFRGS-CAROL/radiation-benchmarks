How to parse radiation logs and calculate cross section

1. Generate the CSVs files with summarized data
	- Run the script "first_parser_sdc-csv-generator.py" in the folder where the logs are located. The logs can be compressed in tar.gz files or just in folders
	- The script will create a folder called logs_parsed with the CSVs files

2. Get the neutron count logs from LANSCE, it should be in the same format as the file lansce_neutron.log located in this folder as an example.

3. Change the procedure getWenderFactor(startDT) from the script calcCrossSection.py to return the correct wender factor according to the time given as input. Wender factors will be provided each experiment and can vary according to time.

4. Compute the distance factor, according to the distance from the board to the shutter given in meters. Use the following equation: 20^2/(x+20)^2 where x is the distance in meters

5. Run the script calcCrossSection.py to generate CSVs with the cross section computed by each run and in 1h timesteps, it will also generate a summary.csv file that will be appended every time you run the script
	- $ ./calcCrossSection.py <lansce neutron count logs> <benchmark csv file> <distance factor>
		- <lasnce neutron count log> log obtained in step 2
		- <benchmark csv file> csv file generated at step 1, usually is named like this: logs_parsed_carol-k402.csv
		- <distance factor> float number computed by the distance of the board from the shutter, computed in step 4
