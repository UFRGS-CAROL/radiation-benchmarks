 * mic_get_mac_from_serial	- Create MAC address from serial number string
 *      \param serial		string containing serial number
 *      \param mac		data space to place MAC address
 *      \param host		if true set least significant bit for hosts MAC
 *
 * mic_get_mac_from_serial() creates a MAC address from a MIC host's serial number.
 *
 * A MAC address contains 6 bytes of which the first 3 are either assigned by IEEE
 * or bit 2 of the first byte is set to indicate locally created.  While awaiting
 * our assigned values, the first the bytes have been set to 'MIC' with the local
 * bit also being set and multicast not.  The result is actually seeing "NIC".
 *
 * The last 3 bytes, or 24 bits are set in the pattern:
 *   o 8 bits are created by subtracting 1 from the cards year character mulitplied
 *     by the work week field.  By subtracting 1 the year starts at 2012 and there
 *     is enough room to accout for MIC cards build through 2017
 *   o 15 bits are the work week running number from the serail number.  This allows
 *     space for 32k of boards to be build in any one week.
 *   o 1 bit is used to indicated whether it is the host or card end of the virtual
 *     network connection.  The bit being set is the card MAC address.
 *
 * Upon successful completion, mic_get_mac_from_serial returns zero.  If the serial
 * number does not have "KC" (for Knights Corner) as the 3rd and 4th characters
 * then the serial number is invalid and a non zero value is returned.
