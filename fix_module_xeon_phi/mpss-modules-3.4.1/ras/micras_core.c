/*
 * RAS handler for core MC events
 *
 * Contains code to intercept MC events, collect information
 * from core MCA banks on originating core and possibly on
 * all active cores if necessary.
 *
 * In case of a severe event, defined by corrupted context,
 * the handler will add a record of the event in the designated
 * EEPROM hanging off the Over-Clocking I2C bus.  Next a message
 * will be sent to the SMC (enabling IPMI notifications) and at
 * last a message is sent to host via the MC SCIF connection
 * (if MC SCIF session has been established).
 *
 * Lesser events will also be sent to the host on a 'FYI' basis,
 * but no record will be stored in the event log, nor will the
 * SMC be notified.
 *
 * Special cases of high rate correctable errors may also cause
 * events to be recorded in EEPROM on the assumption that the
 * root cause will be detectable from maintenance mode.
 *
 * The handler cannot expect any support from the OS while in
 * exception (NMI) context. Therefore, NMI-safe routines has
 * been added to mimic some kernel services, e.g. ee_print().

/*
**
** Brief design notes:
** There are two ways this code normally will be entered.
**
** 1) From standard interrupt context (bottom-half).
**    This is supporting MC events picked up by the
**    machine_check_poll(), i.e. events that aren't
**    causing state corrruption (UC bit not set).
**
** 2) From exception/NMI context.
**    This handles errors that _did_ flag processor
**    state corruption (UC bit set, or other condition
**    causing the kernel exception handler to pick it up).
**  
** Both cases can happen simultaneously on different CPU's,
** which require careful considerations about re-entrant code
** behaviour here. Particularly nasty is exception context where
** normal spinlocks won't work (FYI: x86 spinlocks assume interrupt
** disable can protect a critical region, an assumption that is
** false when an exception/NMI occur).
**
** Standard interrupt context entries occur when non-fatal and
** thus non-critical MC events are handled. In most cases just
** results in a regular SCIF send of McInfo structs to the host.
** Note that the call chain origin is a callout from the timer
** thread, not from an interrupt service routine, so to name
** it as standard interrupt context is somewhat misleading.
**
** Exception context messages are usuallly fatal and must be
** dealt with immediately, because otherwise the generic machine
** handler may panic() the system when exiting exception handler
** (default behavior, may be tweaked by altering 'threshold').
**
** In order to proceed we can either implement a locking mechanism
** at every API function entry, or we can let every function do it's
** thing independently. The latter is preferred, though it gets
** somewhat complicated because the API between the generic MC
** handling and RAS module is in fact composed of several calls.
**
** If state between API calls needs to be tracked then that can be
** done by means of pre-allocated arrays, similar to the generic
** handling in the Linux kernel. Currently the only state variable
** is the mask of CPUs that has been sent an IPI.
**
** Core MC events can be simulated by using the 'mce-inject' tool,
** consisting of a kernel module and a text mode application program.
** The 'mce-inject' module knows the difference between fatal and
** non-fatal events (defined by the UC bit) and acts differently
** in the two cases.  Non-fatal injections cause machine_check_poll()
** to be called on all CPUs, resulting in events being reported to
** function mce_poll().  Fatal injections cause do_machine_check()
** to be called on all CPUs, resulting in calls to the mcc_exc_*
** routines below.  Activities triggered by mce-inject are flagged
** as 'fake', and shall _NOT_ be logged in the EEPROM.
**
** Warning:
** Controls in the generic MC handling may cause the kernel to
** panic, _ALSO_ even if no event was found in any MCA banks!!
** Not sure exactly how to capture that sort of event.
**
** Warning:
** The 'mce-inject' module uses different methods of invoking error
** handling routines, depending on the mce record (inject_flags).
** Specifically, the 'mce-inject' module may use of broadcast NMIs
** to invoke machine_check_poll() or do_machine_check() on all CPUs,
** which will make these functions  execute in exception context.
** The NMI broadcast mechanism is based on registering a handler on
** the 'die' notifier chain and then doing an
**	apic->send_IPI_mask(.., NMI_VECTOR),
** knowing that do_nmi() will invoke this notifier chain when no
** genuine cause of NMI was found (i.e. if inb(61) returns 0xc0,
** [which is SERR + IOCHK on chipset register NSR]).
** Long story short; if 'mce-inject' is used we can not expect that
** polling is done in standard interrupt context, and need to set
** the 'in exception context' flag for SCIF access.

/*
 * Filter for correctable errors, may modify CTL value.
 * The filter is pretty crude, we just want to protect
 * ourselves from being run over by fast recurring events.
 * We keep tabs of events seen in a static array.
 *
 * Algorithm is like this:
 *  - test if event is in filter list; if not exit filter.
 *  - search for instance of this event in history.
 *  - if not found, insert event in history (strike 1).
 *  - if found but time since last seen exceeds window,
 *    then treat event as new in history (new strike 1).
 *  - if found and within time window, bump strike counter.
 *  - if strike counter reach maximum, we're fed up and
 *    turn this event off by clearing the associated
 *    bit in the offending MCA bank's CTL register and
 *    send a 'filter' event notification to the host.
 *
 * Advantages of this design is:
 *  - individual parameters for every filtered event.
 *  - only one event history array.
 *  - no periodic aging of events in history array.
 *  - no averaging over time required.
 *  - no moving/reordering of event history entries.
 *  - new events do not replace older seen event
 *  - filter reacts immediately when max reached.
 *
 * Disadvantages are:
 *  - linear search through filter array.
 *  - linear search through history array.
 *  - time parameter not obvious, it's really a limit
 *    on how old events in history are allowed to be.
 *  - in pathological cases the filter's reaction time
 *    will be max * window (when events trickle in at
 *    a rate just below the window size).
 *  - data in ADDR and MISC registers are not used to
 *    match current event with history. Should they be?
 *
 * For now, both lists are short enough that introducing
 * more advanced searches probably are not going to help.
 *
 * On KnC the flash may have overrides of the mc_turnoff table.

 * Routine to scan the kernel's MC log.
 * Called when SCIF MC session has been created, to bring the host
 * side up to date with prior unreported MC events, such as events
 * occurring when MC session was not active (no peer was listening
 * on the host) and events occurring before RAS module was loaded.
 *
 * Notes:
 *  - This is always called in thread context.
 *  - There are no injection flags in the kernel
 *    MC log, i.e. no guarantee events are genuine.
 *  - The MC kernel log has been exported explicitly for this.
 *
 * On synchronization (or the lack thereof):
 * Effectively the mcelog holds a static array of mce's where the
 * 'finished' flag says whether mce content is valid or not. The
 * 'next' field is the index of the first element in the array that
 * has not been assigned for an MC event. It is incremented when a
 * new event is entered, and reset to zero on reads to /dev/mcelog.
 * The kernel's event log does not wrap, so it is safe to use it as
 * an indicator of how many events (finished or not) are in it.
 * The mcelog's next field is protected by RCU style mechanisms
 * in the kernel MCA handler (see arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mcheck/mce.c).
 * For obvious reasons it is not genuine RCU, e.g. access to 'next'
 * isn't within rcu_read_lock()/rcu_read_unlock() pair, just a clever
 * masking use of a lock in an RCU macro definition.
 * There is no RCU moving data around, the mce array does not move,
 * and the 'finished' flag is set after a wmb() on the mce contents
 * which means this routine will not clash with the MCE handler.
 * Collisions with memset() on reads from /dev/mcelog are prevented
 * by locking of mce_read_mutex.
