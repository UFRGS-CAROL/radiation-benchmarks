/*
 * Definition of the PM interface to the RAS module.
 *
 * Throttle event interface is similar to the MC interface.
 * If a connection is made to MR_TTL_PORT then event records
 * will be sent to the host. Events are sent non-blocking,
 * so if the SCIF buffer runs full, events are dropped until
 * the block disappear (or the session is closed).
 * 
 * Queries are technically implemented as an extension to the 
 * MT interface, and thus are accessible from the host.
 * Except for the risk of conflicting commands written to the
 * two power limit registers, there are no side effects from
 * host side access via SCIF.
 *
 * Currently there are no plans to expose this in SysFs nodes.
 * These routines are just wrappers for read/write access to
 * SMC registers. No precious IP here.

/*
 * Throttle events are provided in raw form, i.e. with as
 * little processing on the card side as possible.
 * For nicer throttle state display, use MT command MR_REQ_TTL.
 *
 * To compensate for the chance of lost events, the full
 * throttle state is transfered in one byte on every message:
 *
 *  Bit#	Content
 *    0		Power trottle state changed
 *    1		New/Current power throttle state
 *    2		Thermal throttle state changed
 *    3		New/Current thermal throttle state
 *    4		Power alert state changed
 *    5		New/Current power alert state
 *
 * By definition, when power and thermal throttle are in effect
 * the KnC is forced to run at reduced speed (600 MHz or so) and
 * with lower operating voltages, i.e. software is not in control.
 * During power alerts the KnC is consuming more power than PLim1
 * and the PM module can reduce speed and/or voltages to reduce
 * power consumption. If power consumption goes beyond PLim0, the
 * hardware (SMC really) will start real power throttles.
 * In effect time spent in power throttle, will also be counted
 * as being in the power alert state. See MT request MR_REQ_TTL.
