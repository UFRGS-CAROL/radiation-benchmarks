/*
 * MC events are provide in raw form, i.e. as close to the
 * contents of MCA register banks as possible. It is not
 * the responsibility of the MCA event handler to perform
 * analysis and interpretation of these registers, beyond
 * determining whether the event was deadly to the uOS.
 *
 * Any data or context corruption _IS_ deadly by definition!
 *
 * Source identifiers:
 *  org	 id
 *    0	 Bank 0 CPU #, core event, range 0..CPU_MAX
 *    1	 Bank 1 CPU #, core event, range 0..CPU_MAX
 *    2	 Bank 2 CPU #, core event, range 0..CPU_MAX
 *    3  DBOX #, uncore event, range 0..DBOX_MAX
 *    4  SBOX,   uncore event, range 0
 *    5	 GBOX #, uncore event, range 0..GBOX_MAX
 *    6	 TBOX #, uncore event, range 0..TBOX_MAX
 *
 * Report flags bits (when set) representing:
 *   [31:5]	Unused (and reserved)
 *	[4]	Filter event, uOS side disabled this event
 *	[3]	Status event, no failure (just MCA bank dump)
 *	[2]	Injected or artificially generated event
 *      [1]	This event has been recorded in EEPROM
 *	[0]	Fatal, the uOS is toast (card needs reset)
 *
 * MCA bank register sizes are not the same on all banks:
 *
 *	    CTL STATUS   ADDR   MISC    Notes
 * CPU 0:    32     64     -      - 	A,M not implemented, always 0
 * CPU 1:    32     64     64     32
 * CPU 2:    32     64     64     - 	M not implemented, always 0
 * DBOX:     32     64     64     - 	M not implemented, always 0
 * SBOX:     32     64     64     64	
 * GBOX:     64     64     64     32	
 * TBOX:     64     64     32     -	M not implemented, not there
