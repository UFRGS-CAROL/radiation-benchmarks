# Filename Manipulation Package #

This package provides portable functions and variables to manipulate the file system :
 
  * [Manipulating filenames](doc/filenames.md) : functions for manipulating filenames ;
  * [Directory functions](doc/dirfunctions.md) : functions for listing and manipulating directories ;
  * [Directory paths](doc/dirpaths.md) : paths to well known directories ;

When this package is loaded, it also computes a number of useful 
variables indicating where the various Torch components are installed.  
Do not change their values.
