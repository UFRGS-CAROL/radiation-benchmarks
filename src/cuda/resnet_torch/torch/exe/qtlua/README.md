QtLua: a Lua interface to QT
==============================

This package includes several useful sub-packages:

  - [qt](doc/qt.md): the global Qt system
  - [qtcore](doc/qtcore.md): Core interface
  - [qtgui](doc/qtgui.md): GUI
  - [qtuiloader](doc/qtuiloader.md): QT Designer UI files loader
  - [qtide](doc/qtide.md): QLua Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
  - [qtsvg](doc/qtsvg.md): Qt SVG support
  - [qtwidget](doc/qtwidget.md): widgets and events

See `qt` and `qtcore` for some binding design notes. A [readthedocs rendered](http://qtlua.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) version of these documents is also available.

To the best of our knowledge, Torch's QtLua implementation is unrelated to -- and very likely incompatible with -- any other Qt-Lua interop projects including:
