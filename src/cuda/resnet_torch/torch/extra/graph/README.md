# Graph Package

This package provides graphical computation for [Torch](https://github.com/torch/torch7/blob/master/README.md).


## Requirements

You need *not* `graphviz` to be able to use this library but, if you have it, you will be able to display the graphs that you have created. For installing the package run the appropriate command below:

```bash
# Mac users
brew install graphviz
# Debian/Ubuntu users
sudo apt-get install graphviz -y
```
