Source of all radiation-benchmarks benchmarks:
    - CLAMR: The CLAMR code is a cell-based adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) mini-app developed as a testbed for hybrid algorithm development using MPI and OpenCL GPU code. 
    - cuda: benchmarks for CUDA architectures
    - heterogeneous: heterogeneous benchmarks
    - hsa: Heterogeneous System Architecture
    - microbenchmarks: simple benchmarks
    - opencl: benchmarks for architectures which have OpenCL support 
    - particles:

- include folder is for log_helper library
- every folder has a config_*.py script which serves as a pre-config for the benchmark in a specific platform
