Description:
  Inverse of the Hilbert Space-Filling Curve Map from a 2D or 3D
domain to the 1D domain.  Two different 2D and 3D domains are
supported.

For the routines 'hsfc2d' and 'hsfc3d' the 2D and 3D domains are
defined as follows.
Note that
  *     0   is the minimum value of an unsigned integer
  *   ~(0u) is the maximum value of an unsigned integer - all bits set
thus the 2D and 3D domains are
  *   [0,~(0u)] x [0,~(0u)]
  *   [0,~(0u)] x [0,~(0u)] x [0,~(0u)]
respectively.

For the routines 'fhsfc2d' and 'fhsfc3d' the 2D and 3D domains are
defines as:
  *   [0.0,1.0] x [0.0,1.0]
  *   [0.0,1.0] x [0.0,1.0] x [0.0,1.0]
respectively.

The 1D domain is a multiword (array of unsigned integers) key.
This key is essentially an unsigned integer of an arbitrary
number of bits.  The most significant bit is the leading bit
of the first (0th) word of the key.  The least significant
bit is the trailing bit of the last word.
